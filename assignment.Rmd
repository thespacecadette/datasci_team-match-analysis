# QUESTION 1
## Write the code to compute the total scored by each team for each match. Note that each goal is worth 10 points and the team that caught the snitch is awarded an extra 50 points. Run your code on the data and present the results in a table showing the season and round number, the match number (a new variable that identies each match of the season), the home and away team names and their scores.

## DATA PREPROCESSING

```{r}
df <- read.csv("competitionResults.csv")

head(df)
```

## THE ALGORITHM

```{r}
# [RESULT] Total scored by each team for each match. Each goal is worth 10 points, team that caught the snitch  awarded extra 50 points. 
# * the season and round number
# * the match number (a new variable that identifies each match of the season)
# * the home and away team names and their scores
seasonTable <- data.frame(matrix(ncol=7, nrow=0))
headings <- c("season", "round", "matchNo", "homeTeam", "homeTeamPoints", "awayTeam", "awayTeamPoints")
colnames(seasonTable) <- headings
print(seasonTable)


for (match_number in 1:nrow(df)) {
  match <- df[match_number,]
  totalPointsHomeTeam <- match[["homeGoals"]] * 10 + ifelse(match[["homeTeam"]] == match[["snitch"]], 50, 0)
  totalPointsAwayTeam <- match[["awayGoals"]] * 10 + ifelse(match[["awayTeam"]] == match[["snitch"]], 50, 0)

  seasonTable[match_number, 1] <- match[["Season"]]
  seasonTable[match_number, 2] <- match[["round"]]
  seasonTable[match_number, 3] <- match_number
  seasonTable[match_number, 4] <- match[["homeTeam"]]
  seasonTable[match_number, 5] <- totalPointsHomeTeam
  seasonTable[match_number, 6] <- match[["awayTeam"]]
  seasonTable[match_number, 7] <- totalPointsAwayTeam
}

head(seasonTable)

```

# QUESTION 2
## The winner of each match has highest score. Each team scores 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw. Team with most points at the end of season is the season winner. 

```{r}
teams_associatedPoints <- data.frame(matrix(ncol=2, nrow=0))

      teams_associatedPoints[nextRowIdx, 2] <- awayTeamFinalPoints
    }
    
  }
  # Order teams by points descending
  teams_associatedPoints_ordered <- order(teams_associatedPoints$totalPoints, decreasing = TRUE) 
  # returns index of order, used to ORDER tables
  resultsLadder <- teams_associatedPoints[teams_associatedPoints_ordered,]
  print(resultsLadder)
}

# [RESULT] Results Ladder: Each team’s points as per the first 5 rounds (ordered by points)
first5MatchesSet <- seasonTable[1:5,]
first_n_matches <- length(first5MatchesSet$season)
buildResultsLadder(first5MatchesSet, first_n_matches)

# [RESULT] Results Ladder: Each team’s points for the full season (ordered by points)

```

# QUESTION 3
## An investigation into home game advantage is planned for the coming months. Write a function that returns a count of the number of home games each team has had, the total number of games each team has played in, the total points scored in a home game and the total number of points the team has scored. Provide these results in a data frame. Run the function on the provided data and show the resulting table output. 

Function below with associated `getTotalPoints()` I've created to handle point/goal calculations. Scroll to next code snippet to test. code

# QUESTION 4

## Provide a table containing the team statistics for all seasons. Including, but not limited to the following: number of games, number of wins, winning percentage, points scored, points conceded, number of snitch catches, goals scored, number of tournament wins. Order the teams in terms of total points scored.

```{r}

# Provide a table containing the team statistics for all seasons. 
data <- read.csv("competitionResults.csv")

# Number of games
games.by.season = aggregate(data$homeGoals ~ data$awayGoals, list(Season=data$Season), FUN=mean)

print(games.by.season)
sprintf("Number of games by season is: % s", games.by.season$)

# Number of wins
# Winning percentage, points scored, points conceded, no of snitch catches, goals scored, number of tournament wins.

# Teams ordered in terms of total points scored.
#
